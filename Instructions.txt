Instructions for PowerUpBot2018 Auton Tool (aka pygame)

Since the positions of the alliance's switch and scales are randomized at the start of the match,
this tool allows you to draw out a path that the robot will take for each of the four possible outcomes.
The program will write instructions to a file, which will be read by the roboRIO on the robot to generate a series of
commands during the autonomous period.

-----------------
MOVING THE ROBOT

Left click anywhere on the field to move the robot. It will automatically turn and move the robot to the cursor's
position, as long as there is nothing in the way.

-----------------
DELTING ACTIONS

Right click anywhere on the screen to delete your last action.
>>>Doesn't work with cloning paths

-----------------
LL-LR-RL-RR

These buttons will switch the path you are currently working on. The first letter represents your switch position,
and the second represents you scale position. Both the switch and the scale are highlighted on the screen to show
which mode you are currently in.
>>>Switching branches doesn't delete anything - everything is saved separately

-----------------
CLONE

This will allow you to copy the current path onto another. Click it to enable CLONE mode, then click on the branch you
want to copy to. You can click CLONE again to stop without copying a path.

-----------------
TO ALL

TO ALL will copy the current path to all other paths.
>>>Don't accidentally click this if you don't want to

-----------------
EXPORT

Write instructions to a file for the robot to read, as well as print out a description of the path the robot will
take for each of the four switch/scale positions
>>>Make sure this is clicked after all other changes are made

-----------------
D.T.C.

Drive To Current will make the robot move forwards until it hits something. You must have already raised the elevator
into position before using DTC, and won't be able to click it until doing so. This is used to drive up to the switch or
scale to ensure the robot is in contact with it before dropping a cube.
There are two ways to call the DriveToCurrent command: one relatively fast, and one slower. Which one is used depends on
which position the elevator is in. If it is raised all the way up, it will move slowly so the elevator will hit the
scale gently before stopping. If it is only raised to the switch position, it will move forward more quickly.
>>>Make sure this is used before dropping a cube into the switch or scale

-----------------
SWITCH

Raises the elevator in position to drop a cube into the switch.

-----------------
SCALE

Raises the elevator in position to drop a cube into the scale.

----------------------------------
>>>Note about SWITCH and SCALE:
Elevator position commands are done in parallel. This means it will execute at the same time as the one that command
after it. Ideally, the elevator should be raised while moving forward, so when drawing the path, make sure
you click SWITCH or SCALE before moving the robot into position.
----------------------------------

-----------------
WAIT

Pauses the program to take in a keboard input. Type in the number of seconds that you want the robot to wait for at
its current position. Press enter to add the command. If you want to leave this mode without adding a pause, press
ESC or click WAIT again.

-----------------
DROP

Runs the cube collector backward to launch the cube out. Can only be used if the elevator is in position
(after SWITCH or SCALE has been clicked)

-----------------
REVERSE

Enables driving backwards when clicking to move the robot. Particularly useful when backing up after dropping
a cube in the switch or scale.

----------------------------------
SAMPLE RUN - left switch and move forward

>>>click on field below alliance switch
	Places robot on starting line facing the switch
>>>SWITCH
	Robot raises elevator to switch position
>>>click close to the switch
	Robot moves forward to area near switch
>>>D.T.C.
	Robot moves forward until it hits the switch
>>>DROP
	Robot drops cube into switch
>>>REVERSE
	Toggle reverse mode on
>>>click on field behind robot
	Robot backs up to cursor position without changing direction
>>>REVERSE
	Toggle reverse mode off
>>>click on field to left of robot
	Robot turns 90deg left and moves forward to cursor position
>>>click far end of field
	Robot turns 90deg right (to 0 deg absolute) and moves forward to cursor position
